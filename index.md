## Welcome to my ML Guide

This website is basically an online journal of my journey in Machine Learning (ML) and the leasons I learned along the way.

### About Me

I am Hetav, a computer engineering student at the University of Toronto and currently interning at Intel as a software developer engineer. My passion for machine learning started when I enetered into my sophomore year and discovered a club called [UTMIST](https://utmist.gitlab.io/) (The University of Toronto Machine Intelligence Student Team). I joined as a member of the academic department and today, I serve as the Co-President of the club along with Vicky Chen. Now enough about me, let's get started with ML!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pandyah5/ML_Info/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
