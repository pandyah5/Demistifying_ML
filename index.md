## Welcome to my ML Guide

This website is basically an online journal of my journey in Machine Learning (ML) and the leasons I learned along the way.

### About Me

I am Hetav, a computer engineering student at the University of Toronto and currently interning at Intel as a software developer engineer. My passion for machine learning started when I enetered into my sophomore year and discovered a club called [UTMIST](https://utmist.gitlab.io/) (The University of Toronto Machine Intelligence Student Team). I joined as a member of the academic department and today, I serve as the Co-President of the club along with Vicky Chen. Now enough about me, let's get started with ML!

### Some general tips

Here are the things that will help people who are just beginning in this field:
- Python and R are the best languages to make ML models.
- Please don't use Python 2, Python 3 is a basic prerequisite for ML.
- Don't stress over which IDE or editor to use, but I'll prefer jupyter notebook or its cloud equialent [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- The best way to learn an ML algorithm is to gets hands-on-experience solving a problem using it.
- You need to get some basic math clear first. Basic calculus, linear algebra and matrix computation is highly recommended.
- Bigger and complex models are not always better.
- Good data is very important, often times more important than the algorithm.
- You don't need a very costly GPU to get started, save your money!
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) has a lots of datasets, they are really good for practice.

### The environment we will be using for this guide

Setting up an ML work environment locally is a pain, atleast it was when I started. So for your comfort I have decided to go through a super efficient way of linking Kaggle and Google Collab that will help you get started in a minute and you can focus more on the code rather than the setup errors.

To understand how to setup a link between Kaggle and Google Collab, you can read my blog post [here](https://medium.com/@pandyahetav1/the-simplest-way-to-link-kaggle-dataset-to-a-google-colab-notebook-fc262ec019b3)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pandyah5/ML_Info/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
